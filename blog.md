### Introduction
Welcome to my blog! First, a quick introduction, I'm a second year undergraduate Computer Science student at Cambridge, with a passion for 
all things deep learning related! 

I am currently writing a series of posts called "Demystifying Deep Learning", which delves into the maths 
behind the deep learning algorithm. I've found from personal experience that most online deep learning resources either skip over the maths, 
just stating the equations or using the algorithms out-of-the-box, or, on the other end of the scale in research, assume an in-depth knowledge
and thus become inaccessible. The aim with these posts is to derive as much of the maths from first principles, thus providing a bridge between 
these two resources. You can access code accompanying these tutorials <a href="http://github.com/mukul-rathi/blogPost-tutorials">here</a>. 

I appreciate any feedback on how to improve both the blog posts, and the projects themselves, as well as project extensions worth 
pursuing further. 


#### _DISCLAIMER_
This blog, and the projects are currently a **work in progress**, and will be evolving as I post more content. 

The current posts are **drafts** and may be incomplete - currently I am updating the design of the blog and adding features, but the focus is on **iterating quickly** then  tidying up later.


To see the screenshots and progress made so far, you can check out the GitHub commits 
<a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/mukul-rathi.github.io">here</a> - for each commit with a visual change, there
is a corresponding screenshot.
