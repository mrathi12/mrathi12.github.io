## Introduction
Welcome to my blog! First, a quick introduction, I'm a second year undergraduate Computer Science student at Cambridge, with a passion for 
all things deep learning related! 

I am currently writing a Demystifying Deep Learning series of blog posts - check them out below!

I appreciate any feedback on how to improve both the blog posts, and the projects themselves, as well as project extensions worth 
pursuing further.

#### _DISCLAIMER_
This blog, and the projects are currently a **work in progress**, and will be evolving as I post more content. 

The current posts are **drafts** and may be incomplete - currently I am updating the design of the blog and adding features, but the focus is on **iterating quickly** then  tidying up later.
