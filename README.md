This is the GitHub repository for my old website. I thought it would be a good way to teach myself some web development - in particular I'm powering this website with React, SASS and GraphQL - all packaged up with GatsbyJS.

Since then, I've interned at Facebook and worked on their web-stack so I've gone and redesigned my site with better web-dev practices.

My new site is a fresh coat of paint: it uses TypeScript and more modern React - gone are the class components, and in their place are Hooks! It's also got a more cohesive design system - I've used Theme UI (powered by Emotion CSS-in-JS).

For now the new-site is closed-source (since I have a raft of blog post drafts that aren't quite ready to share to the world yet!). [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mukulrathi_) to find out when they'll drop!
