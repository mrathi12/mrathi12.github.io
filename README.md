This is the GitHub repository for my personal website. I thought it would be a good way to teach myself some web development - in particular I'm powering this website with React, SASS and GraphQL - all packaged up with GatsbyJS!

To view the website head over to https://mukulrathi.com 

I have a Computer Science blog, with a strong emphasis on deep learning (my pet passion) - for these tutorials I have an accompanying repo https://github.com/mukul-rathi/blogPost-tutorials containing the complete Jupyter Notebook code examples.
