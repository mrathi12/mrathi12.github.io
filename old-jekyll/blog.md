## Introduction
Welcome to my blog! First, a quick introduction, I'm a second year undergraduate Computer Science student at Cambridge, with a passion for 
all things deep learning related! 

I am currently writing a Demystifying Deep Learning series of blog posts - check them out below!

I appreciate any feedback on how to improve both the blog posts, and the projects themselves, as well as project extensions worth 
pursuing further. 

If you liked a particular analogy and want a more detailed explanation using that analogy, or equally if there is something you think can be improved - **comment on the blog post** - I will check out your feedback and update the post accordingly!
