                    Welcome to my blog! First, a quick introduction. For the last few months, I have been deliberating and coming up with a lot of project ideas,
                    which ultimately have yet to come to fruition. The main reason for this is that the ideas were often too ambitious and broad, so ended up 
                    becoming too daunting for me to even begin, for fear of failing. Thus ironically, by not starting, I ended up failing by definition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My intention with this blog is to document my progress, as I experiment and create small projects every day. I aim to focus on rapid
                    iteration, with the goal of just creating and learning new areas of Computer Science and Software Development! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I appreciate any feedback on how to improve both the blog posts, and the projects themselves, as well as project extensions worth 
                    pursuing further. 
                </p>
                <p>This blog, and the projects are a work in progress, and will be evolving as I post more content. 
                    To see the screenshots and progress made so far, you can check out the GitHub commits
