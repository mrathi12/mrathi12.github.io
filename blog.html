                Hello World!
            </h2>
            <div class="blog-intro">
                <p>
                    Welcome to my blog! First, a quick introduction, I'm a second year undergraduate Computer Science student at Cambridge, with a passion for 
                    all things deep learning related! 
                    </p>
                <p>I am currently writing a series of posts called "Demystifying Deep Learning", which delves into the maths 
                    behind the deep learning algorithm. I've found from personal experience that most online deep learning resources either skip over the maths, 
                    just stating the equations or using the algorithms out-of-the-box, or, on the other end of the scale in research, assume an in-depth knowledge
                    and thus become inaccessible. The aim with these posts is to derive as much of the maths from first principles, thus providing a bridge between 
                    these two resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I appreciate any feedback on how to improve both the blog posts, and the projects themselves, as well as project extensions worth 
                    pursuing further. 
                </p>
                <p>This blog, and the projects are a work in progress, and will be evolving as I post more content. The current focus is to create more content,
                    in draft form - once I have more content, the website will be polished and revamped. 
                    To see the screenshots and progress made so far, you can check out the GitHub commits 
                    <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/mukul-rathi.github.io">here</a> - for each commit with a visual change, there
                    is a corresponding screenshot.
